# My Python Journey as an Embedded Software Engineer
Hi there! I'm an electrical and computer science engineer specializing in embedded software engineering, currently in the process of completing a 100-day Python bootcamp. I wanted to share my experience as I work towards improving my skills in this versatile programming language.

# Why I Chose the Bootcamp
As an embedded software engineer, I work with various programming languages on a daily basis. However, I realized that Python is becoming increasingly important in this field and wanted to expand my skillset to include it. The 100-day bootcamp seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so, as it provides an intensive, project-based approach to learning.
