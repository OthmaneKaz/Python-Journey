# My Python Journey as an Embedded Software Engineer
Hi there! I'm an electrical and computer science engineer specializing in embedded software engineering, currently in the process of completing a 100-day Python bootcamp. I wanted to share my experience as I work towards improving my skills in this versatile programming language.
